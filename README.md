# My favourite learning resources

A handpicked list of resources I found useful. They are in no particular order.

## Courses

- [Wes Bos' courses](https://wesbos.com/courses)  
  In general high quality video courses on various topics (many of them focusing on JS).
- [LevelUp Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com/)  
  Scott Tolinski's project, he has a great delivery in his video courses. His business model is slightly different from Wes'. You pay a monthly fee and get access to all his courses. Scott is prolific author whilst maintaining a good quality.
- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)  
  Delivers what it says on the box â€“ videos. I especially appretiated the courses made by Kyle Simpson.
- [Sitepoint Premium](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/library/)  
  A multitude of various video courses and books. I bought a lifetime membership when it still was called Learnable and it was one of the best investments into my self-education I made.
- [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com)  
  One of the first interactive course platforms I stumbled upon around 2012(?). They're still great, even better.
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  An interactive course that will let you try all the `git` commands without the fear for breaking anything. It has a nice visual representation. I learned to navigate the commit tree thanks to this course.
- [Webpack Learning Academy](https://webpack.academy/)  
  After these free video courses, Webpack started to make some sense.
- [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org/)  
  Interactive course platform and community. I really like this for its noble values â€“ providing programming courses â€“ and the quality is also pretty good.
- [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)  
  This is kind of funny, but I guess a good intro into blockchain programming.

## Books

- [Clean Code, _Robert C. Martin Series_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)  
  This book showed me how to write code which is easier to understand. Since we started applying the principles outlined in this book on our team, the understanding of code in between developers became a breeze. Uses Java syntax for examples.
- [You Don't Know JS, _Kyle Simpson_](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)  
  I came across this series when I already had pretty solid knowledge of Javascript. Or at least so I thought! These books go into the inner workings of the JS engine and explain how it actually works. The first version was so good that I happilly supported Kyle in his effort to write and publish the second edition.
- [CSS: The Definitive Guide, _Eric A. Meyer_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26420.CSS)  
  This book was hard to read as it's essentially a reference guide with explanations. BUT it was this book that gave me the understanding of how the CSS box model works.
- [The Coding Career Handbook, _Shawn @swyx Wang_](https://www.learninpublic.org/)  
  Another great book. Swyx collected his tips based in a wide spectrum of knowledge from the IT industry.
- [Pure React, David Cedia](https://daveceddia.podia.com/pure-react-complete-package)  
  David taught me to _think React_. This deffo helped me to understand how React works. I recommended this book to all my collegues and it really shows who read it and who did not.
- [ECMAScript 2015: A SitePoint Anthology](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/ecmascript-2015-a-sitepoint-anthology/)  
  A collection of articles about Javascript ES6.
- [Jump Start Git, _Shaumik Daityari_](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-git-2nd-edition)  
  A consise description of what Git is and how to use it.
- [Professional Git](sitepoint.com/premium/books/professional-git)  
  Quoting the classic: _"We gotta go deeper!"_ This is an indepth look into using Git.
